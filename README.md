# AdventureWorks2019 Group Project
A group project where we were provided with the AdventureWorks2019 dataset and given 6 questions to be answered in both a report and in a client facing presentation. Data was cleaned in SQL and visualisations were created using matplotlib.
I was tasked with answering questions 5 and 6, while also providing input for the other questions and helping create the accompanying report and powerpoint presentation.
